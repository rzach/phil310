\begin{prob}
Let $\Gamma$ be the set of all sentences $!A$ in the language of
arithmetic such that $\Sat{N}{!A}$, i.e., $\Gamma$ contains all
sentences true in the ``standard model.'' Show that there is a
model~$\Struct M$ of $\Gamma$ which is not covered, i.e., some
$a \in \Domain{M}$ is such that $a \neq \Value{t}{M}$ for all
closed terms~$t$.
